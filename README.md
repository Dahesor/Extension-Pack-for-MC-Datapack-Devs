# Extension Pack for MC Datapack Devs

These are the extensions I would recommend you to use to develop Minecraft: Java Edition projects (Datapacks, Maps, etc.), from a personal perspective.

## What's Included and Why

### Datapack Helper Plus by Spyglass

The best data pack language support you can find, providing you with real-time error reporting, auto-completion, semantic coloring, and code navigation tools. This includes `mcfunction` and JSON files in data packs.

### Syntax-Mcfunction

A dependency of Datapack Helper Plus that provides syntax highlighting. It does not provide any auto-completion or syntax validations on its own. Nice to have it installed because the above does not activate on individual mcfunction files.

### MC Datapack Utility

Provides you with some extra features on data pack development, like creating data packs from template, converting formule into `scoreboard` commands, creating function files without typing the `.mcfunction` extension name, etc.

### Shader languages support for VS Code

If you need some shader magic for your project, then you'll probably need an extension to provide support for the glsl language.

### NBT Viewer

This extension lets you view and edit nbt binary files. It also shows a 3D block view for sturcture files.

### Mcdoc Syntax Highlighting

Datapack Helper Plus now allows you customize NBT auto-completion by writing a `.mcdoc` file. Be sure to take advantage of that!
